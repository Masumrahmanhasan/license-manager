## License Manager
**License Manager** is a library build for laravel framework. It is intended to allow developers to be able to license their applications without having to create a licensing system of their own. **FYI : This library is still under heavy development and is not in a completed state! You will be able to do nothing with it right now.**

## Getting Started

## Contributing
